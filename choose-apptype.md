# Advocating for a Hybrid App Architecture for a University Social Networking Mobile App

# Status
**Status:** Accepted


## Content
Our team is tasked with developing a mobile app for a university social networking platform. The app aims to connect students and professors, facilitate information sharing about classes, events, clubs, and manage schedules. Additionally, the app needs to support offline functionality, ensure compatibility with a variety of devices, integrate with the university's existing Active Directory system, utilize push notifications, prioritize data privacy and security, and adhere to accessibility guidelines.

## Decision
We propose adopting a Hybrid App Architecture for the development of the university social networking mobile app. This architecture will utilize a single codebase to achieve cross-platform compatibility, ensuring widespread adoption and accessibility on both iOS and Android platforms.

**Reasoning**

- Efficient Development and Maintenance: By utilizing a hybrid approach, we can write a single codebase using frameworks such as React Native, thereby significantly reducing development time and effort compared to building separate native apps for iOS and Android.

- Offline Functionality: Hybrid frameworks allow for the implementation of offline capabilities and data synchronization mechanisms, enabling users to access certain features and data even when offline. This addresses the need for stable app performance in low or no connectivity scenarios.

- Optimized Performance: Hybrid apps can be optimized to perform efficiently on a range of devices, including those with varying performance capabilities. Techniques such as code optimization and responsive design will be employed to minimize data usage and enhance app compatibility.

- Integration with Active Directory: Hybrid frameworks support integration with existing authentication systems like Active Directory, enabling secure login and appropriate role and permissions enforcement for both students and professors.

- Push Notification Integration: Hybrid frameworks offer seamless integration with various push notification providers, allowing us to select a suitable provider that supports both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring users are promptly informed about relevant updates.

- Data Privacy and Security: The hybrid app will prioritize data privacy and security by implementing encryption, secure data transmission protocols, and adhering to relevant data protection regulations, thereby safeguarding sensitive information.

- Accessibility Features: Hybrid frameworks enable the implementation of accessibility features, ensuring the app is inclusive and meets accessibility guidelines. Features such as text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and support for assistive technologies will be integrated to accommodate a range of diverse user needs.

# Conclusion
Overall, we believe that the adoption of a Hybrid App Architecture will simplify development and maintenance, encouraging widespread app usage on various platforms. Additionally, integrating offline capabilities and data synchronization will notably improve user experience, especially for those with intermittent internet connectivity. Additionally, optimizing performance and ensuring compatibility across diverse devices will cater to the wide user base comprising students and professors.

Furthermore, seamless integration with the existing Active Directory system will enhance security through secure logins and role enforcement. Effective integration of push notifications will keep users informed and engaged with timely updates, fostering a more engaging user experience. Prioritizing data privacy and security measures will establish trust and confidence among users, enhancing the app's credibility. Lastly, incorporating accessibility features will ensure the app is usable and beneficial for all users, thereby adhering to accessibility guidelines.
