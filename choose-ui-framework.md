# Advocating for React and React Native as UI Frameworks for Developing a Hybrid Social Networking Mobile App for a University

##
**Status:** Accepted


## Content
Our team is tasked with developing a hybrid mobile app for a university's social networking platform. The app aims to connect students and professors, facilitate information sharing about classes, events, clubs, and manage schedules. It is essential that the app supports both iOS and Android platforms for widespread adoption and accessibility. Furthermore, the app should offer offline capabilities, optimize performance for a variety of devices, integrate with the university's existing Active Directory system for secure user authentication and access control, incorporate push notifications, prioritize data privacy and security, and ensure inclusivity through accessibility features.

## Decision
We propose utilizing React and React Native as the primary UI frameworks for developing the hybrid social networking mobile app for the university.

**Reasoning**
- Cross-Platform Development and Efficiency: React Native enables efficient development and maintenance across multiple platforms (iOS and Android) by utilizing a single codebase. This aligns with the requirement for widespread adoption and accessibility.

- Offline Mode and Data Synchronization: React Native provides robust support for implementing offline capabilities and data synchronization mechanisms, ensuring a seamless user experience even when users have limited or no internet connectivity.

- Optimized Performance and Compatibility: React and React Native allow for performance optimization by employing techniques to enhance app compatibility and minimize data usage, addressing the diverse range of smartphones used by students and professors.

- Integration with Active Directory for Access Control: React and React Native enable seamless integration with existing authentication systems like Active Directory, allowing for secure user login and appropriate role and permissions enforcement for students and professors.

- Push Notification Integration: React Native offers straightforward integration with various push notification providers, enabling us to select a suitable provider that supports both iOS and Android platforms to keep users informed about important updates.

- Data Privacy and Security: React and React Native provide a secure environment for handling sensitive information by allowing the implementation of encryption, secure data transmission protocols, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

- Inclusivity through Accessibility Features: React and React Native support the integration of accessibility features, such as text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and support for assistive technologies, aligning with the requirement to ensure inclusivity and adherence to accessibility guidelines.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, we believe that using React and React Native as the UI frameworks for the hybrid mobile app promises efficient development and maintenance, enabling widespread adoption on both iOS and Android platforms. The integration of these frameworks ensures robust offline capabilities and seamless data synchronization, providing an uninterrupted user experience, even in low-connectivity scenarios. Performance optimization and device compatibility enhancements will further elevate the user experience, catering to the varied smartphone landscape among students and professors.

Moreover, the proposed integration with the existing Active Directory system will fortify the app's security by ensuring secure user authentication and effective access control. Through effective integration of push notifications, users will receive timely updates and event notifications, enhancing their engagement and interaction within the app. Lastly, the implementation of accessibility features will guarantee that the app is user-friendly and inclusive, meeting the needs of all users, including those with specific accessibility requirements.
